This plugin generates thumbnails of local images.

The Daddy plugin will call it if you add particular atributes to the [img] tag.

Exemple:

[img="images/mypicture.jpg" scale=50]

Then the image will be reduced by 50%.


[img="images/mypicture.jpg" width=500]

The image wil be resized using 500px as width, the ratio will be kept.

Same with "height" instead of "width".
You can use the both together but the ration won't be kept.

Alternatively, you can "autoresize" all the images using the following option:
$fmbConf['thumb']['autoreduce']

Exemple:

$fmbConf['thumb']['autoreduce'] = 500;

All the images will be resized using 500px as width (unless the image isn't
bigger than 500px)


Here are the available options:
$fmbConf['thumb']['autoreduce']  // auto resize large images
$fmbConf['thumb']['mode']        // mode of the generated images
$fmbConf['thumb']['path']        // where to store the thumbnails

Defaults:

$fmbConf['thumb']['mode'] = 0640;
$fmbConf['thumb']['path'] = "<plugin_path>/thumbs";
