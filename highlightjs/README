Highlightjs allows you to enable syntax highlighting.
Your code must be sorrounded by the "<pre><code>" tags.

By default highlighjs tries to autodetext the laguage, but you can force it
using the "class" attribute of the <code> tag.

Example:

<pre><code class="C">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    fprintf (stdout, "Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

There are multiple themes available, take a look at the highlight.js/styles
directory.
To use a specific theme, you can set the following option in your config file:

$fmbConf['highlightjs']['theme'] = 'github';
